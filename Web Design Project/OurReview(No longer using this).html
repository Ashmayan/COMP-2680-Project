			<p>The Playstation 5 is quite the leap when it comes to performance this generation.<br>Compared to its Playstation 4 counterpart, it posesses many new features.
			The first of which is its ultra fast Solid State Drive or SSD for short. The SSD is not only responsible for storing<br> games as a storage device, 
			but also loading them very quickly.I have included a video to showcase just how fast it can be. It's next big feature is the 4K/8K HDR support. This<br>
			allows for excellent video quality and an incredibly clear picture when playing games. The controller this time around is also a vast improvement with its haptic
			feedback (click <a href="https://www.ultraleap.com/company/news/blog/what-is-haptic-feedback/#:~:text=Haptic%20feedback%20is%20the%20use,is%20much%20more%20than%20that.">here<br></a> for more information on haptic feedback) and built-in microphone, which allows for communicating with other players.
			The last big feature added is the Playstation 5's<br>Graphics Processing Unit, which allows ultra realistic graphics and an average framerate of 60 FPS. Playing games has never been so clean!
			The one and only downside I can think of, is the somewhat lack of space on the SSD. If you're someone who likes to have a bunch of games downloaded at once, you'll quickly find yourself
			needing to purchase extra storage space. Overall given all of the new amazing features and the presence of only one small downside, I'd give the PS5 a solid 9/10.
